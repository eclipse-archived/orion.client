Orion
=====

Orion is an open-source development platform focused on creating applications for the web, in the web.

The vision behind Orion is to move software development to the web by 
enabling open tool integration through HTTP and REST, JSON, OAuth, OpenID, and others. 
We exploit internet design principles throughout, allowing Orion to be easily run in the browser, locally and in Electron. 

Great care has been taken to provide a world class web development experience, rather than to recreate the traditional desktop
IDE experience in a browser tab.

Please refer to our [project page](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ecd.orion) for plan and overall project information, or
head over to the [wiki](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion) for even more information about Orion.
