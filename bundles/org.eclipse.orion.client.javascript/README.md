**Orion JavaScript Tools** are a suite of tools to help JavaScript developers write better code. Faster.

# Features

### Content Assist

Need some help while coding? Activate content assist for code completions, keywords and templates.

Content assist can be easily extended to understand 3rd party libraries and comes preconfigured for 
**Browser**, **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, **Redis**, **MySQL** and more!

To activate the libraries in your source simply add a jslint or eslint-env directive at the top of your source indicating which library to use.

For example to use **Node.js** we would add the following:

```javascript
/* eslint-env node */
```
### Customizable Linting

Backed by the power and speed of [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint), the linting rules in Orion can be configured on a per-rule basis. 

Don't like being nagged about unused parameters? Simply turn it off in the easy to use preference dialog or add a directive for the rule you want disabled:
```javascript
/* eslint no-unused-params:0 */
```

will disable flagging unused parameters in functions.

### Mark Occurrences

Turn this editor option on to find all relevant occurrences of the selected token. 

Currently finds occurrrences of identifiers, function declarations and correctly-scoped this usage.

### Source Outline

Using the super convenient **Ctrl+O** keybinding (or the **View** menu) you can view an outline of your source. Clicking outline elements 
takes you to the relevant position in the source.

### Hovers

In 8.0 we introduced a variety of hovers in the source. You can navigate from `importScript`, `define` statements
and `require` statement, see documentation for functions and even fix some linting problems!
