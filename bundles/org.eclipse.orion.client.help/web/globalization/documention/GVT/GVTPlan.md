Orion 8.0 GVT Test Plan
========
## Author: Libing wang (libing_wang@ca.ibm.com)
## Revision: 2.0
## Date: April 11th, 2015

Overview
========
This test plan covers how to log into an Orion account as a specific GVT Tester and how to walk
through the Orion User Interface and Pages checking for GVT issues.

Orion is essentially an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with the exception that instead of
downloading it and running it on your desktop, all you need is a modern browser (Orion will warn you
if your browser is out of date) and a login to the Orion web site you want to test.

Orion is made up of different pages that accomplish common tasks developers need to write code.
This test plan will cover the different pages and how to navigate around them. It is important to note
that there is a flow to this test plan that should result in the tester leaving the “workspace” (or the files
in the server accessed by Orion) in the same state as when they started. Everything that is added to
the testers workspace is eventually deleted in the set of tests and then the tester logs out.

Since Orion is a web app, there are a few terms that should be covered. The first thing is the selection
policy in Orion. Orion does support context sensitive menus in the navigator however often you
have to select a row in the UI. To do this click in the row but not over any content. Clicking on a “filename”
in a list of files does not necessarily select it, it might open it up in the editor. So to “select”
that file, click to the right but in the same horizontal space as the filename

Logging In
========
Use gvttester1, gvttester2, gvttester3 as user names to login to  http://tvt80.orion.eclipse.org:9000/.

All tests are prefixed with a GVT##### for referencing in bug reports if necessary

# Part 1  Editor
## GVT0100  After logging in you will be put into the Editor Page. Check the following page

## GVT0120  Modify the Project Name, Description, and Site.
1) Move your mouse over the project “Name” in the “Project Information” section on the right-hand
side and click on it. Modify the name.

2) Move your mouse over the empty project “Description” area and click on it. Input a project description
of your choice.

3) Move your mouse over the empty project “Site” area and click on it. Input a website address of
your choice.

![image](images/image05.png)

4) Click outside of the “Site” input box. This will save the newly entered Site.

5) Refresh the page. Verify that the information you entered was saved correctly and that the project
name in the navigator on the left hand side matches the new project name you entered in the
Project Information section. Note that the breadcrumb (highlighted below) will still have the original
project name you selected when you created the project. At the time this document was written
this is the expected behavior.

## GVT0130  New file/folder creation
1) Create a new file using the File menu. Click on File->New->File

2) Input a file name of your choice and press the Enter key

![image](images/image07.png)

3) Verify that a new file with the name you entered was created. An icon should appear next to the
file name and it should be automatically opened in the Editor on the right- hand side. The breadcrumb
should indicate the new file name correctly.

4) Create a new folder and verify that it was successfully created with the name you selected by repeating
steps 1-3 and selecting Folder instead of File from the File->New menu in step 1.

## GVT0150  Find renamed file using “Find File” dialog
1) Ensure that the file you renamed in the previous test is NOT open in the editor. You can do this by
opening the project.json file or by clicking on the renamed folder to open it.

2) Launch the Find File dialog by pressing Ctrl+Shift+F (Cmd+Shift+F MacOS).

3) Start typing the name of the file you renamed in the previous test. You should see a link to the file
appear below the text input. Click on it and make sure that the file has been successfully opened
in the editor.

GVT0160  Text file input
1) Open the file you renamed in the previous test by clicking on the file name in the navigator on the
left-hand side.

## GVT0170  Searching and replacing in a file
1) Open the file you created in the previous step.

2) Ensure the file has at least 3 lines of content with repeated words and save it. You can do this by
copying the first line and pasting it twice. (Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V keyboard shortcuts should work, Mac
equivalents should work as well, otherwise you can use the Edit menu to copy and paste)

3) Place your cursor at the beginning of the file and press Ctrl+F (Cmd+F MacOS) to open the
find/replace dialog.

5) Ensure the text is highlighted properly for the first match (subsequent matches show in lighter
color).

6) Press “enter/return” to match the next entry. You should be able to keep pressing enter to loop
around the matches.

7) Type in a replacement string in the language of your choice in the “Replace With” entry field and
press “Replace”.
