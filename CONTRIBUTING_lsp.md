#Contributing to Orion/LSP Support

Thanks for your interest in this project.

#Steps to reproduce:

1) Clone the git repository : [https://git.eclipse.org/r/orion/org.eclipse.orion.client] and checkout the `java-lsp` branch.

2) Get the lsp server from the Git repo: [https://github.com/gorkem/java-language-server] and follow the `README.md` file to build it.

3) Install the lsp server in the `org.eclipse.orion.client/modules/orionode/server` folder.

4) Inside a console where Node.js is installed, do:
  - `npm install`
  - start it by using: `node --debug server.js -p 8083 --w <workspace_path>`
  This runs the Node.js Orion server on localhost:8083.

5) Open the browser on `http://local.orion.org:8083`.
The Orion client with the Java™ plugin requires a Node.js Orion server that is enabled for the language server connections.
This is why for now we use a local Node.js server instead of the instance running on orion.eclipse.org.
