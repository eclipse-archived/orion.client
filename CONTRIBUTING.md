Contributing to Orion
=====================
Thanks for your interest in this project.

Project description
--------------------
Orion's objective is to create a browser-based open tool integration platform which is entirely focused on
developing for the web, in the web. Tools are written in JavaScript and run in the browser. Great care has
been taken to provide a web experience for development, rather than to recreate the traditional desktop
IDE experience in a browser tab.
