The goal of Orion is to build developer tooling that works in the browser, at web scale.
The vision behind Orion is to move software development to the web as a web experience, by enabling
open tool integration through HTTP and REST, JSON, OAuth, OpenID, and others. The idea
is to exploit internet design principles throughout, instead of trying to bring existing
desktop IDE concepts to the browser. See http://wiki.eclipse.org/Orion for more
information about Orion.
